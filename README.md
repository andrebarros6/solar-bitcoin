# Solar & Bitcoin Time Series Forecasting with SARIMAX

This project explores the potential predictive relationship between solar activity and Bitcoin prices using time series forecasting meant to evaluate if Bitcoin mining can make solar panel installation be made more profitable. It was developed as part of my final project for the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp, showcasing my ability to apply statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to real-world data.


## üîç Project Overview

Goal: Verify if Bitcoin minig can make solar panel installation more profitable. Predict Bitcoin prices using sunspot data (a proxy for solar activity) and historical BTC price.

Model Used: SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors)

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Plotly

Key Concepts: Time Series Analysis, Feature Engineering, Supervised ML, Forecasting---


## üíº Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:

Proficiency in time series forecasting and advanced statistical modeling

Ability to work with multi-source data and clean, merge, and transform it

Competence in developing and evaluating predictive models (train/test split, diagnostics)

Effective use of Python tools and visualizations to communicate results

Understanding of model deployment considerations (saving/loading models with pickle)
